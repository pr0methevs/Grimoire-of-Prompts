# prompts-collection

A curated collection of reusable prompts and instruction files (found online for free) tailored for large language models, designed to streamline prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and deployment across diverse NLP tasks. This repository also documents and organizes a wide range of prompt-engineering paradigms, styles, and best practices—from chain-of-thought and role-based prompting to instruction-hierarchy design, meta-prompting, and advanced conversational scaffolding—serving as both a practical toolkit and an educational reference for modern promptcraft.
