Re-phase ${sentence} for a technical audience instead of novices, focus on precision, depth, and familiarity with domain terminology. Here are concrete steps you can follow:

1. **Assume Prior Knowledge**
- Treat readers as professionals who already understand the basic concepts.
- Omit elementary explanations and instead dive straight into advanced details or new developments.
    
2. **Use Technical Jargon (with Context When Needed)**
- Incorporate field‑specific terminology and acronyms.
- If a term might still be ambiguous, provide a brief, precise definition or a reference link.
- This shows respect for the reader’s expertise while keeping the content clear.

3. **Emphasize Depth and Breadth**
- Cover multiple facets of the topic: architecture, implementation, performance trade‑offs, and future trends.
- Include sidebars, code snippets, or case studies that demonstrate real‑world application.

4. **Apply Modular Formatting**
- Break the prompt into sections or steps that can be independently examined.
- Use collapsible headers or numbered subsections to help readers navigate complex information. 

5. **Adopt an Active, Direct Voice**
- Write in a tone that is confident and authoritative.
- Use the active voice to clearly state actions or expectations. 

6. **Incorporate Feedback Loops**
- Encourage the model to ask clarifying questions if ambiguous.
- Offer options for the model to generate multiple variants and let the user select the best fit.
- Consider A/B testing or user surveys to refine the prompt over time. 

7. **Provide Examples of Professional Prompts** 
- Show a template that uses precise language:
    > “Given the following dataset schema, generate a SQL query that optimizes read performance for concurrent transactions, including an explanation of index usage.”
    
- This gives the model a concrete, expert‑level target to emulate. walkwithpic.com

By implementing these strategies, your prompt will resonate with technical readers who appreciate depth, specificity, and a professional but kind tone.
